# Collaboration and Cyberinfrastructure for Paleogeosciences (C4P) Cataloging Effort

> A collection of web resources and vocabulary expanded as part of the  [C4P](http://workspace.earthcube.org/c4p) effort.


## Background
The dataset started as a crowd sourcing effort at the EarthCube Paleogeoscience Domain Working Group meeting in Minneapolis Minnesota. From there it was worked on by Douglas Fils and Anders Noren to add further items to the collection.

Later the set became part of an effort by the Cyberinfrastructure for PaleoGeoscience RCN (http://workspace.earthcube.org/c4p) funded by the NSF EarthCube effort. As part of this effort a greatly expanded version of the list was created under the guidance of Dave Anderson, of NCDC/NOOA. Student workers Ryan Lingo, and Kaleb Horlick, under Dave's guidance have generated the latest version of the list available in the resources section.

## Usages

1. Paleoseek.net :
   The sets are used as part of the Google custome search instance at [paleoseek.net](http://paleoseek.net/)
   
2. CINERGI :
   The sets also contribute to the larger CINERGI collection.  A PivotView version of this data is at: 
   [CINERGI C4P Pivot viewer](http://hydro10.sdsc.edu/c4pviewer/CommunityPivotTestPage.html). 
   This is part of the [CINERGI](http://workspace.earthcube.org/cinergi) effort. 

## Files
The input files are located in the dataSets directory.  They are

1.  Glossary-Vocab-TopLevel.csv :   The top level concept terms
2.  Glossary-Vocab-SecondLevel.csv:  Terms that have are narrower versions of the top level terms
