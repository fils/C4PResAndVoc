atmosphericSciences,"an umbrella term for the study of the atmosphere, its processes, the effects other systems have on the atmosphere, and the effects of the atmosphere on these other systems. Meteorology includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics with a major focus on weather forecasting. Climatology is the study of atmospheric changes (both long and short-term) that define average climates and their change over time, due to both natural and anthropogenic climate variability. Aeronomy is the study of the upper layers of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important. Atmospheric science has been extended to the field of planetary science and the study of the atmospheres of the planets of the solar system.","aerosols, atmosphericChemistry, atmosphericDynamics, atmosphericPhysics, environmentalSciences, isotopicGeology, meteorology, nephology"
climatology,"the study of climate, scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of time.","dendrochronology, glacialGeology, lacustrineSedimentology, limnology, palynology, paleoenvironment, paleofire"

oceanography,"branch of Earth science that studies the ocean. It covers a wide range of topics, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries.","bathymetry, deepSeaResearch, marineGeoscience, paleobathymetry, paleoceanography, paleomagnetism, oceanography"
paleobiology,"combines the methods and findings of the natural science biology with the methods and findings of the earth science paleontology. It is occasionally referred to as ""geobiology"".","biofacies, biostratinomy, calcareousNannofossil, fossilization, invertebrate, vertebrate, geoarcheology, ichnology, mammalPaleobiology, microfossil, micropaleobiology, morphology, paleobiogeography, paleobiology, paleobotany, paleoecology, paleoentomology, paleofire, paleoichthyology, paleontology, paleozoology, palynology, taphonomy"
